## Just incase you needed these

I made this tutorial during my documentation on PHP, It includes almost everything about PHP with comments. You just have to try and read through and use google as back up. 

Also if you have any question don't hesitate come and ask of course if you didn't understand something by googling it.

## Tips

Try to read the code I typed and if you could re-code it yourself in different examples that would be a plus.

Make sure you start by going from the basics into the html includes then the PHP Includes. and finish it off by going to classes and objects.

Feel free to skip parts you already know.

### Here is the chaining of the basics
⌨️ 0.Using Checkboxes
⌨️ 1.Associative Arrays
⌨️ 2.Functions
⌨️ 3.Return Statements
⌨️ 4.Building a Calculator (Using if statements)
⌨️ 5.Switch Statements
⌨️ 6.While Loops
⌨️ 7.For Loops
⌨️ 8.Comments

## Extensions you might need to install

PHP IntelliSense
PHP Intelephense
PHP Debug
Open PHP/HTML/JS In Browser
and a Theme that would help you see clear code I personally use(Atom One Dark).

GOOD LUCK AND HAPPY CODING.

With love #Anassifi.
